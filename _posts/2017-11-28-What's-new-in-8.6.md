title: What's new in 8.6
---

libvips 8.6 is done! Though it's a bit late. This post summarizes what's new
-- check the [ChangeLog](link) if you need more details. 

## New operators

There are five new operators. 

The most complex is [`vips_composite2()`](link-to-docs): this will composite
a pair of transparent images together using PDF-style blending modes. For
example, given the standard libtiff and libpng demo images:

[![PNG and TIFF demo images]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tn_pngtiff.jpg)]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/pngtiff.png)

Running:

```
$ vips composite2 cramps.png png_demo1.png x.png over
```

Gives:

[![Composite of PNG and TIFF demo images]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tn_composite.jpg)]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/composite.png)

`over` is probably the most useful, but `composite2` supports all the [PDF blend
modes](link-to-docs-when-we-have-them-up).

`composite2` joins a pair of images, but you can join a whole array of images
using an array of blend modes in a single operation with `composite`. Options
let you control the compositing space and premultiplication handling.

[`vips_fill_nearest()`](docs) Replaces every zero pixel in an image with the
nearest non-zero pixel. For example:

[![Fill nearest image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tn_fill-nearest.jpg)]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/fill-nearest.png)

The zero pixels on the left have all been replaced. It's reasonably quick
(about a second for that example on this old laptop) and doesn't need that much
memory. It's handy for things like cell counting, where you want to assign cell
pixels to the nearest nucleus.

[`vips_find_trim()`](docs) searches an image in from the edges and returns the
bounding box of the non-background pixels. It's handy for automatically 
trimming away the edges from scanned images.

[`vips_gravity()`](docs) places an image within a larger canvas, positioning
the image according to a compass direction. It's just `vips_embed()` with a
convenient interface.

[`vips_thumbnail_image()`](docs) lets you thumbnail any image source. It can be
useful if you need to do something to an image before making a thumbnail.

## New features

There are a few new options for existing operations:

* A `FORCE` resize mode lets you break the image aspect ratio in resizing. 

* `thumbnail` and `vipsthumbnail` have an option for rendering intent, credit
  to kleisauke.

* `vips_text()` can autofit text to a box. You give the size of the box to
  fill, and it'll automatically search for a DPI that just fills that area. 
  Credit to gargsms.

* `VIPS_COMBINE_MIN` is a new combining mode for `vips_compass()`, handy for
  estimating gradients. 

* `vips_hist_find_indexed()` now has a `combine` parameter. This makes it
  possible to quickly find the bounding boxes of a large number of objects, for
  example.

* `vips_affine()` and `vips_similarity()` have a `background` parameter.
  Previously, they always used 0 for new pixels and you had to composite on
  something else somehow.

* The nasty jaggies on the edges of affine output have been fixed, credit to
  chregu.

## Image format improvements

As usual the image load and save operations have had a large set of
improvements:

* The FITS loader supports images with leading non-image HDUs, credit to
  benepo.

* All savers support a `page_height` option for multipage save.

* `tiffsave_buffer` supports for pyramid save, credit to bubba.

* `svgload` handles very large output gracefully, and handles missing width 
  and height, credit to lovell.

* The GIF loader adds `gif-delay`, `gif-comment` and `gif-loop` metadata.

* The GIF loader knows about dispose handling, so it can correctly load complex
  animated GIFs.

## Changes 

There have been a few changes to existing features:

* The built-in Python bindings for vips7 and vips8 are now deprecated and are
  disabled by default. They are still there and still work, but we now 
  strongly recommend the new `pyvips` binding in pip. 

* The Python part of the libvips test suite has been removed and is now in
  `pyvips`.

* `vips_conv()`, `vips_compass()`, `vips_convsep()` default to `FLOAT` 
  precision. This prevents bad and unexpected behaviour in a few obvious cases. 

* The `centre` option for `vips_resize()` is deprecated -- it's now always on.

## Fixes and small improvements

Finally there are a range of smaller improvements:

* New C API: `vips_image_new_from_image()` and `vips_image_new_from_image1()` 
  make a constant image. This has been added to all the language bindings too.

* Better prefix guessing on Windows, credit to tumagonx.

* libvips now sets file create time on Windows, credit to dlong500.

* The `disc` load property has been renamed as `memory` and defaults off.

* libvips has much better gobject-introspection annotations, credit to astavale.

* `vips_image_write()` severs all links between images, when it can. This fixes
  a range of annoying problems in large programs. Credit to Warren and Nakilon.

* The vector path for convolution is more accurate and can handle larger masks.

* Linear and cubic kernels for reduce are much higher quality.

* Setting the EXIF data block automatically sets the derived image tags.

Plus many even smaller bug fixes and improvements. As usual, the 
ChangeLog has more detail, if you're interested.
